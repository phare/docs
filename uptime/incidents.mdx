When things go wrong, having a clear process makes all the difference. Phare's incident management system takes care of the entire incident lifecycle automatically, from the moment a problem is detected to when everything's back to normal.

## Programmatic incidents

When a monitor detects trouble (respecting your confirmation settings and any keyword/SSL checks), Phare springs into action by creating an incident. Each incident is automatically linked to the affected monitor and includes detailed information about what went wrong. Right away, alert recipients are notified through your configured alert rules, no manual intervention required.

Programmatic incidents track the entire lifecycle from detection through resolution, giving you a complete picture of what happened during the outage.

## Manual incidents

Sometimes you need to create an incident even when your monitors haven't detected a problem. Perhaps a customer reported an issue with a service you're not actively monitoring, or you want to proactively communicate about planned maintenance.

Phare makes it easy to create incidents manually:

1. Select the affected monitor(s)
2. Set the impact level
3. Add a descriptive title
4. Include details about the situation

Manual incidents follow the same lifecycle as programmatic ones, but you'll need to resolve them manually when the issue is fixed. This gives you full control over the incident's duration and communication timeline.

## Incident recovery

When your service recovers (again, respecting your recovery confirmation settings), Phare automatically resolves the incident and notifies recipients through your alert rules.

## Impact

Not all incidents are created equal. That's why Phare lets you classify incidents by their impact level:

- **Unknown**: Still investigating, not sure how bad it is
- **Operational**: False alarm. Everything's working as expected
- **Maintenance**: Planned downtime for heavy-duty updates
- **Degraded performance**: Things are slower / working less well than usual
- **Partial outage**: Some users are affected or certain features are down
- **Major outage**: Everything is on fire, users can't access the service or are severely impacted

Impact levels help prioritize responses internally and keep users informed through status pages. If left as "unknown," status pages will simply show the monitor as "down" without additional details.

## Event timeline

        alt="Incident event timeline"
    />
</Frame>

The event timeline gives you the full picture of what happened during an incident. You can see every region's status, which alert rules fired, and follow the incident's progression from start to finish. This chronological view helps with post-incident analysis and improves response procedures over time.

## Incident comments

Team members can add private comments to share insights or document solutions, helping everyone resolve issues faster. These internal notes are perfect for:

- Documenting troubleshooting steps
- Sharing relevant links to logs or dashboards
- Coordinating response efforts between team members
- Recording root cause analysis findings

The rich text editor supports Markdown, making it easy to include formatted text, code snippets, or links to relevant resources. Comments are only visible to organization members and never appear on public status pages.

Each comment is timestamped and attributed to its author, creating a clear record of who did what during incident response.

## Incident updates

        src="/images/uptime/incidents/uptime-status-pages-publish-update.webp"
        alt="Publish an incident update"
    />
</Frame>

While comments help private collaboration, incident updates are designed for external communication. These updates allow you to keep users informed about:

- What's happening with the incident
- What you're doing to fix it
- When they can expect resolution
- Workarounds they can use in the meantime

Each update allows you to communicate progress as you mitigate the issue and is automatically published to connected status pages, helping maintain transparency with users during outages.

Consistent, clear communication during incidents builds trust. Users appreciate knowing the situation is under control even when things aren't working perfectly.

## Smart incident merging

Smart incident merging reduces noise by grouping multiple, similar failures into a single incident that evolves over time. Instead of opening a new incident for every affected monitor, Phare can merge them together, keep one timeline, and notify recipients more intelligently.

### Configuration

Smart incident merging can be configured per-project, allowing you to tailor the behavior to different services or groups. You can also set a preferred time window for merging, balancing responsiveness with noise reduction.

        src="/images/uptime/incidents/incident-merging-configuration.webp"
        alt="Smart Incident merging project settings"
    />
</Frame>

<Note>Start with a moderate window of 10 to 30 minutes. If you often experience bursty or cascading failures, a longer window will reduce duplicate incidents further.</Note>

### How it works

Only incidents belonging to the same project can be merged together. When a new incident is created, even before confirmation, Phare checks for any existing open incidents in the project that share the same reported issue. If it finds one within the configured time window, it merges the new incident into the existing one.

This approach, even though simple, provides fast and reliable results for most incident scenarios.

### Dedicated alert rule events

Two alert rule events are available to help you react precisely to incident propagation and partial recoveries:

- [Incident Propagated](/uptime/alerting#>-incident-propagated)
- [Incident Partially Recovered](/uptime/alerting#>-incident-partially-recovered)

Paired with notification threads on the [Email](/integrations/email), [Discord](/integrations/discord), or [Slack](/integrations/slack) integrations, notifications stay focused: one creation, threaded follow‑ups for expansions and partial recoveries, and a final recovery when everything is back to normal.

## Incident AI

Incident AI leverages the [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) platform to analyze incident data and generate useful summaries and post-mortem reports. By understanding the context and details of each incident, Incident AI helps resolve issues faster and improve future response strategies.

### Configuration

Incident AI can be activated per-project, allowing compliance with different data policies across your organization.

        src="/images/uptime/incidents/incident-ai-configuration.webp"
        alt="Incident AI project settings"
    />
</Frame>

### How it works

When activated, Phare will automatically generate an AI incident summary when an automated incident is created, and a post-mortem report when it is resolved. Incident AI is not active on manually created incidents.

Each AI generation consumes one credit from your plan's monthly allowance. When the quota is exhausted, no further AI generation is performed until the next billing cycle. Additional quota can be configured if your organization is subscribed to the Scale plan.

    />
</Frame>

<Note>Incident AI is in its early stages and may not always produce perfect results. Carefully review AI-generated content before sharing it with users.</Note>

### Privacy

To protect your data, Incident AI only processes strictly necessary information related to the incident, such as:

- Incident data
- Impacted monitors
- Failed request responses
- Incident event timeline
- Incident comments
- Incident updates

Sensitive data like monitor name, API keys, HTTP header values, or user emails are redacted with anonymization tokens in the payload sent to Mistral AI. Phare uses Mistral's paid plan which [does not train artificial intelligence models on your data](https://help.mistral.ai/en/articles/347617-do-you-use-my-user-data-to-train-your-artificial-intelligence-models#scale-plan-pay-per-use-subscription).

### Improving Incident AI

You can rate each AI generation by using the thumbs up/down buttons next to the AI content to provide your feedback. Phare will use this feedback in the future to fine-tune a custom model specifically for incident management. Only rated AI generations will be used for this purpose.
