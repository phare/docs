Status pages are your public-facing communication hub during both good times and bad. They show your users the real-time status of your services, any ongoing incidents, and planned maintenance. The best part? Status pages by Phare are lightning-fast and the most [eco-friendly](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/status-phare-io/) you can find!

## Creating a status page

Create as many status pages as your projects need, there's no limit. Pick which monitors to display, customize the look to match your brand, and give Phare a few seconds to generate an SSL certificate. Your status page will be ready to shine! Want to make changes later? No problem—customize anytime.

## Phare domain

Every status page gets its own `*.status.phare.io` domain name, complete with SSL protection out of the box.

## Custom domain

Want your status page on your own domain? Simply create a CNAME record in your DNS settings pointing to `cname.status.phare.io`:

| Type  | Name               | Target                |
| :---- | :----------------- | :-------------------- |
| CNAME | status.example.com | cname.status.phare.io |

Make sure your DNS is configured correctly so Phare can generate a valid SSL certificate—this usually takes a few minutes. Once verified, your Phare domain will automatically redirect to your custom domain.

### Custom domain with Cloudflare DNS

Using Cloudflare? Make sure to create your CNAME with proxy status in `DNS-only` mode (keep the cloud icon gray, not orange) as shown below:

### Custom domain with Bunny.net

Hello fellow Bunny enthusiast!

Since Phare also uses Bunny.net for domain management, there's an extra security step needed. Don't worry, it's quick and straightforward:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a TXT record">
        Add this TXT record to your DNS settings to help Bunny.net verify your request:

| Type | Name               | Target                |
| :--- | :----------------- | :-------------------- |
| TXT  | status.example.com | Bunny Support - Phare |

    </Step>
    <Step title="Open a support ticket">
        Head over to your [Bunny.net support hub](https://dash.bunny.net/support/tickets) and create a new ticket.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Write a message">
        Select the **DNS** department and send something like this (with your actual domain):

        ```text
        Hello Bunny.net team,

        I created a CNAME entry for my subdomain status.example.com that points to cname.status.phare.io.

        Phare.io is also using Bunny, and they need your authorization to add my subdomain on their PullZone and generate an SSL certificate for my subdomain. Could you please whitelist my domain for multi-use across the bunny platform? I've created a TXT record called `Bunny Support - Phare` as proof of ownership.

        Thank you for being awesome!
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Wait for the ticket to be processed">
        Bunny's support team is usually quick, sit tight for a few minutes.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify your custom domain">
        Once resolved, go back to your <a href="https://app.phare.io/uptime/status-pages" rel="nofollow">status page dashboard</a> and hit the `Verify again` button to activate your custom domain.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Status badges

Once your status page is live, you get access to status badges you can proudly display on your website or repository. They're a great way to show transparency and confidence in your service reliability. Access them through your status page's action menu.

- `background-light`: Background color in light mode.
- `background-dark`: Background color in dark mode.
- `text-light`: Text color in light mode.
- `text-dark`: Text color in dark mode.

Colors accept standard hex formats (RGB, RGBA, RRGGBB, or RRGGBBAA). Not feeling creative? There's already some stylish presets ready to go.
