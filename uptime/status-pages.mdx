Status pages are a great way to keep your users in the loop. They are a public page that displays the status of your monitors, and any incidents or maintenance periods that are currently ongoing. Status pages built with Phare are extremely fast and carbon efficient!

## Creating a status page

You can create an unlimited number of status pages for all your projects. Choose which monitoring data you want to display, and customize the look and feel of your status page to match your brand. Allow Phare a few seconds to generate an SSL certificate for your status page, and you're good to go! The status page can be customized at any time.

## Phare domain

All status pages possesses a unique `*.status.phare.io` domain name, protected by an SSL certificate.

## Custom domain

You can host your status page on a custom domain. This is a great way to keep your brand consistent across all your services. To set up a custom domain, you need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings that points to `cname.status.phare.io`.

| Type  | Name               | Target                |
|:------|:-------------------|:----------------------|
| CNAME | status.example.com | cname.status.phare.io |

The domain name needs to be configured properly for Phare to generate a valid SSL certificate and activate HTTPS on your status page, which can take a few minutes.

Once your custom domain is verified, the Phare domain (`*.status.phare.io`) associated to your status page will automatically redirect to your custom domain.

### Custom domain with Cloudflare DNS

If you are using Cloudflare DNS, you need create the CNAME with proxy status in `DNS-only` mode (the cloud icon must stay gray and not orange) as shown on the following screenshot:

### Custom domain with Bunny.net

Hello there fellow Bunny.net enjoyer!

Because Phare also uses Bunny.net for sub-domain management, an extra security step is required on your end to allow us to generate an SSL certificate. Don't worry though, it's a quick and easy process!

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a TXT record">
        Create a TXT record in your DNS settings with the following values, this will allow Bunny.net support to verify that your request is genuine

| Type | Name               | Target                |
|:-----|:-------------------|:----------------------|
| TXT  | status.example.com | Bunny Support - Phare |
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open a support ticket">
        Navigate to your [Bunny.net support hub](https://dash.bunny.net/support/tickets) and open a new support ticket.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Write a message">
        Select the **DNS** department and write a message similar to the following with the custom domain you want to use:

        ```text
        Hello Bunny.net team,

        I created a CNAME entry for my subdomain status.example.com that points to cname.status.phare.io.

        Phare.io is also using Bunny, and they need your authorization to add my subdomain on their PullZone and generate an SSL certificate for my subdomain. Could you please whitelist my domain for multi-use across the bunny platform? I've created a TXT record called `Bunny Support - Phare` as proof of ownership.

        Thank you for being awesome!
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Wait for the ticket to be processed">
        Wait a few minutes for the ticket to be processed by one of their great support agents.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify your custom domain">
        Once the ticket is resolved, go back to [your status page dashboard](https://app.phare.io/uptime/status-pages) and click the `Verify again` button to activate your custom domain.

## Status badges

Once your status page is created, you get access to a set of status badges that you can embed on your website or repository. These badges are a great way to show your users that your service is up and running, and can be accessed from your status page's action menu.

- `background-light`: Background color used when the badge is in light mode.
- `background-dark`: Background color used when the badge is in dark mode.
- `text-light`: Text color used when the badge is in light mode.
- `text-dark`: Text color used when the badge is in dark mode.

All colors accept hexadecimal values, with the following formats:

- `RGB`: #FFF
- `RGBA`: #FFFF
- `RRGGBB`: #FFFFFF
- `RRGGBBAA`: #FFFFFFFF

If you're not feeling creative, you can use one of the provided style presets.
