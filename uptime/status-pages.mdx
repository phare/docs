Status pages are a great way to keep your users in the loop. They are a public page that displays the status of your monitors, and any incidents or maintenance periods that are currently ongoing. Status pages built with Phare are extremely fast and carbon efficient!

## Creating a status page

You can create an unlimited number of status pages for all your projects. Choose which monitoring data you want to display, and customize the look and feel of your status page to match your brand. Allow Phare a few seconds to generate an SSL certificate for your status page, and you're good to go! The status page can be customized at any time.

## Status page domain

Currently, all status pages are created with a `*.status.phare.io` domain name, you will soon be able to create status pages with your own domain name and an SSL certificate handled by Phare.
