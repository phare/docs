Phare Uptime is your digital babysitter that keeps an eye on your websites and APIs 24/7. Alerting you if anything goes wrong, before your users start complaining.

## Uptime Monitoring

Think of uptime monitoring as your website's health checkup. Phare regularly visits your website or API, checks its vital signs, and lets you know if something looks off.

## Incident Management

When things go sideways, you need a system to track what happened, who's fixing it, and when it's resolved. Phare's incident management gives you the tools to handle the entire lifecycle, from "oh no!" to "all good!"

## Status pages

Status pages let your users know what's going on when your service isn't performing as expected. A little transparency goes a long way in building trust.
