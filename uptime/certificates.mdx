SSL certificates are essential for website security. Phare makes monitoring and managing them straightforward by automatically detecting and tracking certificates across your domains.

## How certificate discovery works

Phare integrates certificate discovery directly into the monitoring system:

- Certificates are automatically detected when Phare monitors your domains
- Multiple certificates per domain are properly tracked and managed
- Certificates covering multiple domains are linked to all relevant monitors
- New certificates are identified and added to your inventory as they appear

## Certificate monitoring

Keep track of your SSL certificates with these helpful features:

- **Automatic notifications** when new certificates are discovered on your domains
- **Customizable expiration alerts** that can be set anywhere from 1 to 60 days before expiry
- **Complete certificate inventory** showing both active and historical certificates
- **Detailed certificate information** including issuer, validity period, and domain coverage

## Preventing Certificate Expiration Issues

With Phare's certificate monitoring, you can avoid the security warnings and outages that occur when certificates expire unexpectedly. Set up your preferred notification schedule, to get reminded when it's time to renew, or when certbot failed to renew your certificates.
