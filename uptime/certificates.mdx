SSL/TLS certificates are essential for securing endpoints. Phare makes monitoring and management straightforward by automatically detecting and tracking certificates across websites, APIs, and services.

## How certificate discovery works

Phare integrates certificate discovery directly into the monitoring system for any HTTPS endpoint or TCP endpoint with TLS enabled.

- Certificates are automatically detected when Phare monitors your endpoints
- Multiple certificates per monitor are properly tracked and managed
- Certificates are linked to all relevant monitors
- New certificates are identified and added to your inventory as they appear

## Certificate monitoring

Keep track of your SSL/TLS certificates with these helpful features:

- **Automatic notifications** when new certificates are discovered on your domains
- **Customizable expiration alerts** that can be set anywhere from 1 to 60 days before expiry
- **Complete certificate inventory** showing both active and historical certificates
- **Detailed certificate information** including issuer, validity period, and domain coverage

## Preventing certificate expiration issues

With Phare's certificate monitoring, you can avoid the security warnings and outages that occur when certificates expire unexpectedly. Set a preferred notification schedule to get reminders when it's time to renew, or when certbot fails to renew certificates.
