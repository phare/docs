SSL/TLS certificates are essential for securing your endpoints, Phare makes monitoring and managing them straightforward by automatically detecting and tracking certificates across your websites, APIs and services.

## How certificate discovery works

Phare integrates certificate discovery directly into the monitoring system for any HTTPS or TCP with TLS connection endpoints.

- Certificates are automatically detected when Phare monitors your endpoints
- Multiple certificates per monitor are properly tracked and managed
- Certificates are linked to all relevant monitors
- New certificates are identified and added to your inventory as they appear

## Certificate monitoring

Keep track of your SSL/TLS certificates with these helpful features:

- **Automatic notifications** when new certificates are discovered on your domains
- **Customizable expiration alerts** that can be set anywhere from 1 to 60 days before expiry
- **Complete certificate inventory** showing both active and historical certificates
- **Detailed certificate information** including issuer, validity period, and domain coverage

## Preventing Certificate Expiration Issues

With Phare's certificate monitoring, you can avoid the security warnings and outages that occur when certificates expire unexpectedly. Set up your preferred notification schedule, to get reminded when it's time to renew, or when certbot failed to renew your certificates.
