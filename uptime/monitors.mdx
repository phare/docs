Monitors are the core of Phare Uptime, they are used to monitor the availability of your website and servers, and send you alerts when something goes wrong. Monitors can perform three types of checks to determine if your website or server is online and working as expected: HTTP(s), TCP, and UDP.

### HTTP(s)

An HTTP(s) request is sent to your website, Phare Uptime check the response status code and the presence of an optional keyword in the response body to determine if your website is online and working. Additionally, you can activate SSL certificate monitoring to get alerted when your SSL certificate is expired or misconfigured.

### TCP & UDP

A TCP or UDP connection is established with your server, Phare Uptime sends a fixed string and waits for a response to determine if your server is online and working as expected.

## Interval

You can configure the interval at which Phare Uptime will send requests to your website or server. The default interval is 1 minute, but you can configure it to be 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes.

## Confirmations & recovery

Phare Uptime uses a confirmation system to avoid false positives.
A monitor is marked as down or recovered only after a certain number of consecutive failures / successes.
The default number of confirmations is two, but you can configure it to be anything between one (immediate confirmation) and five confirmations.

## Regions

Phare Uptime provides nine regions around the world to monitor your website or server from different locations. You can choose to monitor your website or server from a single region, or from multiple regions. **Using at least two regions is recommended to avoid false positives**.

## Alert policy

Phare Uptime provides a powerful alerting system to notify your team members of an incident based on alert policies. You can attach a different alert policy to each monitor, and you can create as many alert policies as you want.

## Firewall protection

Our monitoring infrastructure uses a vast range of IPs from the [Cloudflare global network](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ips/) to provide the widest available monitoring offer at an affordable price. Phare is not the only company using this range of IP addresses. Therefore, IP filtering should not be relied upon to control access to our monitoring traffic.

The simplest solution is to filter by user-agent. However, if you require a more robust option, please [contact us](mailto:support@phare.io).

## User agent

Phare Uptime monitoring HTTP requests always contain the following user-agent:

> `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Phare/1.0; +https://phare.io/products/uptime)`

## Limits

Our monitoring infrastructure allows us to work at an extraordinary scale, but comes with a few drawbacks:

- **Enforced HTTPS validation**: Website accessed with the HTTPS protocol MUST use a valid SSL certificate. Self-signed, expired or poorly configured SSL certificate will yield an error. There is no way to bypass this validation.
- **No HTTPS with IP hostname**: It is possible to monitor a website using an IP address hostname with the HTTP protocol but not with the HTTPS protocol.
- **No TCP port 25**: Monitoring a service with TCP on port 25 is not possible.

We understand that these limits can be a major blocking point, feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@phare.io) if you would like to discuss alternatives or contournement solutions.


Depending on your firewall configuration, it is possible that traffic coming from the Phare monitoring infrastructure gets blocked.
To avoid any issue, you can make sure to allow Phare monitoring traffic
