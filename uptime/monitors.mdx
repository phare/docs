Monitors are the core of Phare Uptime, they are used to monitor the availability of your website and servers, and send you alerts when something goes wrong. Monitors can perform HTTP(s) and TCP checks to determine if your website or server is online and working as expected.

### HTTP(s)

An HTTP(s) request is sent to your website, Phare Uptime check the response status code and the presence of an optional keyword in the response body to determine if your website is online and working. SSL certificate monitoring is automatically activated for websites using HTTPS, which will alert you when a certificate is expired or misconfigured.

### TCP

A TCP socket connection is established with your server to determine if it is online and working as expected.

## Interval

You can configure the interval at which Phare Uptime will send requests to your website or server. The default interval is 1 minute, but you can configure it to be as low as 30 seconds or 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 minutes.

## Confirmations & recovery

Phare Uptime uses a confirmation system to avoid false positives.
A monitor is marked as down or recovered only after a certain number of consecutive failures / successes.
The default number of confirmations is two, but you can configure it to be anything between one (immediate confirmation) and five confirmations.

## Regions

Phare Uptime provides 11 regions around the world to monitor your website or server from different locations. You can choose to monitor your website or server from a single region or from multiple regions. **Using at least two regions is recommended to avoid false positives, and be resilient against large scale outage**.

## Alert Rules

Phare Uptime provides a powerful alerting system to notify your team members of an incident based on [alert rules](/uptime/alerting).

## Firewall protection

IP filtering is not recommended as Phare rely on IPs provided by [Bunny.net global network](https://bunnycdn.com/api/system/edgeserverlist) to provide the widest available monitoring offer at an affordable price. The easiest solution to filter Phare's uptime agent traffic is to filter by user-agent.

If you require a more robust option, please [contact us](mailto:support@phare.io).

## User agent

Phare Uptime monitoring HTTP requests always contain the following user-agent:

> `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Phare/1.0; +https://phare.io/products/uptime)`

## Private monitoring agent

It is possible to set up a private monitoring agent in a region of your choice. This can be used to comply with complex requirements, large scale monitoring, or private VPN access.

You can [contact us](mailto:support@phare.io) to discuss your needs.

## Limits

Phare's monitoring infrastructure works at an extraordinary scale, but comes with a few drawbacks:

- **No IP filtering**: Phare uptime agent uses a vast range of IPs provided by [Bunny.net global network](https://bunnycdn.com/api/system/edgeserverlist) that are shared.
- **Enforced HTTPS validation**: Website accessed with the HTTPS protocol MUST use a valid SSL certificate.
- **Restricted ports**: The following ports are restricted and cannot be used for TCP monitoring: 25, 465, 587, and 2525.

We understand that these limits can be a major blocking point, feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@phare.io) if you would like to discuss alternative solutions.
