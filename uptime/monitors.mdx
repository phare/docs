Monitors are the backbone of Phare Uptime, they're your tireless digital assistants checking if your website or server is alive and kicking. Set them up once, and they'll dutifully perform HTTP(S) and TCP checks according to your schedule.

### HTTP(s)

When monitoring websites, Phare sends HTTP(s) requests and checks both the status code and (optionally) looks for specific text in the response. If HTTPS is used, Phare automatically keep an eye on your SSL certificates too, making sure it's valid and well configured.

### TCP

For services beyond websites, TCP monitoring establishes a direct connection to your server port to make sure everything's responding correctly.

## Interval

You decide how often Phare checks on your endpoints. The default is every minute, but you can adjust the frequency to suit your needs, anything between a quick 30 seconds or a relaxed 1 hour.

## Confirmations & recovery

Nobody likes false alarms. That's why Phare allows double-checks, or more, before creating an incident. A service is only marked as down (or recovered) after a configurable number of consecutive failures (or successes). The default is two confirmations, but you can set this anywhere from one (immediate alerts) to five checks.

## Regions

With 11 monitoring regions worldwide, Phare lets you check your services from different parts of the globe. **It is strongly recommend to use at least two regions**, this helps avoid false positives and keeps your monitoring resilient even if one region experiences issues.

## Alert Rules

Phare alert rules system allows you to decide which events trigger notifications. There's a few alert event that can be raised by monitors, you can find the full list in the [alerting documentation](/uptime/alerting).

## Firewall protection

IP filtering is not reliable as the Phare Uptime monitoring agent is deployed on [Bunny.net's global network](https://bunnycdn.com/api/system/edgeserverlist), meaning that IPs could be shared with other Bunny.net customers.

The easiest way to filter the Phare Uptime monitoring agent is to use the `User-Agent` header. You can also add a secret value to the user agent to make it unique to your organization.

## User agent

Every HTTP request from Phare carries this user-agent signature:

> `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Phare/1.0; +https://phare.io/products/uptime)`

If you added a `secret-value` to the user agent, it will look like this:

> `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Phare/1.0; +https://phare.io/products/uptime; Secret=secret-value)`

## Need help deciding which settings are right for you?

If you're unsure about the best settings for your monitoring needs, you can find the [Best practices to configure an uptime monitoring service](https://phare.io/blog/best-practices-to-configure-an-uptime-monitoring-service/) on the Phare blog.

## Private monitoring agent

Need specialized monitoring for complex requirements, large-scale operations, or access through private VPNs? A private monitoring agent can be setup in your preferred region.

[Let's talk](https://phare.io/contact) about your specific needs.

## Limits

Phare's monitoring infrastructure operates at impressive scale, but comes with a few constraints:

- **No IP filtering**: The monitoring agent uses Bunny.net's shared IP range, making IP filtering unreliable.
- **Strict HTTPS validation**: HTTPS websites must have valid SSL certificatesâ€”no exceptions.
- **Certain ports restricted**: TCP monitoring doesn't support ports 25, 465, 587, and 2525.

If these limitations are showstoppers for you, [reach out](https://phare.io/contact) to discuss alternatives.
