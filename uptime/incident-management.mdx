When things go wrong, having a clear process makes all the difference. Phare's incident management system takes care of the entire incident lifecycle automatically, from the moment a problem is detected to when everything's back to normal.

## Incident creation

When a monitor detects trouble (respecting your confirmation settings and any keyword/SSL checks), Phare springs into action by creating an incident. Right away, your team gets notified through your default alert rules—no manual intervention required.

## Incident recovery

When your service recovers (again, respecting your recovery confirmation settings), Phare automatically resolves the incident and lets your team know through your alert rules.

## Impact

Not all incidents are created equal. That's why Phare lets your team classify incidents by their impact level:

- **Unknown**: Still investigating, not sure how bad it is
- **Operational**: False alarm—everything's working as expected
- **Maintenance**: Planned downtime for heavy-duty updates
- **Degraded performance**: Things are slower / working less well than usual
- **Partial outage**: Some users are affected or certain features are down
- **Major outage**: Everything is on fire, users can't access the service or are severely impacted

Impact levels help your team prioritize responses internally and keep users informed through status pages. If left as "unknown," status pages will simply show the monitor as "down" without additional details.

## Event timeline

The event timeline gives you the full picture of what happened during an incident. You can see every check status, which alert rules fired, and follow the incident's progression from start to finish.

Team members can add comments to share insights or document solutions, helping everyone resolve issues faster. The rich text editor supports Markdown, making it easy to include formatted text, code snippets, or links to relevant resources.
