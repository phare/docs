### Alert Rules

Think of alert rules as your notification command center. Each rule defines four key elements:

- **Event**: What triggers the alert (like a monitor failing or a certificate nearing expiration)
- **Scope**: Where the rule applies (organization-wide or just in specific projects)
- **Rate limit**: How often the notification can be sent (preventing notification fatigue)
- **Integration**: Where to send the alert (email, Slack, Discord, etc.)

Additional settings can be configured depending on the event type and integration you choose.

### Event

Phare can alert you of various events, including:

- Monitor created
- Monitor deleted
- Monitor certificate updated
- Monitor certificate expiring
- Incident created
- Incident recovered
- Incident comment created
- Incident update published

You choose which events matter most to your team, and can set up multiple alert rules for a single event type.

### Scope

Keep your alerts relevant by setting the right scope:

- **Organization**: Catch all matching events across your entire organization
- **Project**: Focus only on events within specific projects

This targeted approach ensures nobody gets alerts they don't need to act on.

### Rate Limiting

Too many notifications can lead to alert fatigue. That's why Phare lets you set limits on how frequently a notification can be sent. Even if an event triggers multiple times, you'll only be notified based on your preferred cadence, like at most once every 10 minutes.

### Notification Channels

Connect any [integration](/integrations/overview) to your alert rules to receive notifications through your preferred channels. Create as many alert rules as you need, customizing each one to get the right balance of information without overwhelming your team.
