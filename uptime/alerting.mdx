### Alert Rules

Think of alert rules as your notification command center. Each rule defines four key elements:

- **Event**: What triggers the alert (like a monitor failing or a certificate nearing expiration)
- **Scope**: Where the rule applies (organization-wide or just in specific projects)
- **Rate limit**: How often the notification can be sent (preventing notification fatigue)
- **Integration**: Where to send the alert (email, Slack, Discord, etc.)

Additional settings can be configured depending on the event type and integration you choose.

### Events

Phare can alert you of various events, each with their own configuration options and utility. You choose which events matter most to your team, and can set up multiple alert rules for a single event type.

#### > Monitor created

Sent when a new monitor is created, great for logging or auditing purposes.

#### > Monitor deleted

Sent when a monitor is deleted, great for logging or auditing purposes.

#### > Monitor certificate updated

Sent when a monitor's SSL certificate is updated, useful for tracking changes and certificate renewal confirmation.

#### > Monitor certificate expiring

Sent when a monitor's SSL certificate is nearing expiration, based on a configurable threshold.

#### > Incident created

Sent when a new incident is created, this is the main alert for incident management.

#### > Incident propagated

Sent when an incident propagate to an additional monitor. Requires smart incident merging to be enabled.

#### > Incident partially recovered

Sent when a monitor recovers but the incident is still ongoing due to other affected monitors. Requires smart incident merging to be enabled.

#### > Incident recovered

Sent when an incident has fully recovered, indicating that all affected monitors are back to normal.

#### > Incident comment created

Sent when a new comment is added to an incident, useful for keeping team members informed of updates and discussions.

#### > Incident update published

Sent when a new public incident update is published on a status page, useful for notifying stakeholders and users about the incident status.

### Scope

Keep your alerts relevant by setting the right scope:

- **Organization**: Catch all matching events across your entire organization
- **Project**: Focus only on events within specific projects

This targeted approach ensures nobody gets alerts they don't need to act on.

### Rate Limiting

Too many notifications can lead to alert fatigue. That's why Phare lets you set limits on how frequently a notification can be sent. Even if an event triggers multiple times, you'll only be notified based on your preferred cadence, like at most once every 10 minutes.

### Notification Channels

Connect any [integration](/integrations/overview) to your alert rules to receive notifications through your preferred channels. Create as many alert rules as you need, customizing each one to get the right balance of information without overwhelming your team.
