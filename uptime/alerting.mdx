Phare Uptime allows you to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur, such as monitor failures, SSL certificate issues, or incident updates. The system is built around flexible, scoped alert rules.

### Alert Rules

An alert rule defines:

- Event: The event that triggers the alert (e.g., incident created, certificate expiring).
- Scope: Whether the rule applies organization-wide or within a specific project.
- Rate limit: Prevents spamming your team members with notifications.
- Alert integration: Which integration to use for sending notifications (e.g., email, Slack, Discord).

### Event

The event specifies what action or occurrence will trigger the alert. Phare Uptime supports a variety of events, including:

- Monitor created
- Monitor deleted
- Monitor certificate updated
- Monitor certificate expiring
- Incident created
- Incident recovered
- Incident comment created
- Incident update published

### Scope

You can choose the scope of each alert rule:

- Organization: The rule applies to all matching events in the organization.
- Project: The rule applies only to events that occur within a specific project.

This scoped system provides both flexibility and clarity, ensuring alerts are relevant to the right context.

### Rate Limiting

To prevent notification overload, alert rules support rate limiting. This allows you to restrict how often an alert rule will send a notification in a given time frame. For example, you can set a rule to notify you only once every 10 minutes, even if the triggering event occurs multiple times within that period.

### Notification Channels

Any [alert rule integration](/integrations/overview) can be used to send notifications. You can create an unlimited number of alert rules for each integration, allowing you to customize how and when you receive notifications.
