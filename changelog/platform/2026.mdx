    ## Improved webhook JSON editor

    The JSON editor to customize outgoing webhook payloads now highlights valid placeholders and loop names, warns on invalid tokens, and suggests available entities and properties as you type.

    Editing is smoother too: new lines are pre-filled, error handling is clearer, and the editor can expand for large schemas.

    It's like a small handcrafted IDE inside of Phare 🌞

    ## Outgoing webhook schema upgrades

    Schemas now support loops, and the default schemas for every alert event have been revamped to expose richer data out of the box. The new placeholder syntax uses `{{ entity.property }}` and is documented in the [Outgoing Webhooks docs](/integrations/outgoing-webhook#payload-customization).

    ## Improved notifications preferences

    Important organization-level notifications are now sent to all admins, not just the organization owner. In addition,
    every user can opt out of individual notification types from their personal settings.

    This removes the single-owner bottleneck while keeping you in control of what lands in your inbox.

    ## Custom quota notification thresholds

    Notification thresholds for billable quotas are now fully configurable. Instead of fixed alerts at 80% and 100%, each quota can trigger notifications at values that actually match how you monitor usage.

    This is useful if you want earlier warnings for critical quotas or fewer alerts for ones you don't care about.

    ## Legal and Billing emails per organization

    Organizations can now configure separate **Legal** and **Billing** email addresses. The legal email is used for privacy policy and terms of service updates, while the billing email receives invoices and other payment-related notifications.

    If your legal and finance departments are actually just you, feel free to send both emails to yourself and role-play.

    ## Native ilert integration

    Phare now integrates natively with [ilert](https://www.ilert.com/?utm_campaign=316508387-Phare%20Uptime&utm_source=integration&utm_medium=organic)! Connect your ilert account to receive incident alerts directly in your existing incident management workflow, ensuring your team stays informed and can respond quickly to any issues.

    Read more about the [ilert integration](/integrations/ilert) in the documentation.
