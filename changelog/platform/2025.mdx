    ## New alert event: Monitor certificate expiring

    You can now create alert rules to be notified when your monitor certificates are about to expire. This new feature complements the SSL certificate tracking system introduced earlier this week, giving you proactive control over your certificate renewals.

    How it works:
    - Create a **Monitor Certificate Expiring** alert rule
    - Select how many days in advance you want to be notified (from 1 to 60 days)
    - Choose which integration to use for notifications (Email, SMS, Webhook, etc.)
    - Get timely notifications so you never miss a certificate renewal again

    Like other alert rules, you can scope it to a specific project or to the entire organization, and it works with all existing integrations.

    ## New alert event: Monitor certificate discovered

    You can now create alert rules to be notified when a new certificate is discovered on any monitor. It's a great way to make sure they're getting renewed on time, or to get alerted of any unexpected changes to your monitors' SSL certificates.

    ## SSL certificate tracking

    Phare now tracks SSL certificates as first-class objects, giving you visibility on all the certificates used in your projects.

    How it works:

    - Certificates are discovered and stored automatically when performing monitor checks
    - Support for multiple certificates per domain and shared certificates across monitors

    This allows you to quickly view all certificates used by a monitor, and all monitors using a certificate.

    ## New scoped alert rules system


    Alert policies have been replaced with a more intuitive scoped alert rules system. You can now define alert rules that apply at the organization or project level, making alerting easier to manage and more transparent.

    How it works:
    - Alert policies do not exist anymore
    - Alert rules can be directly created
    - Choose a scope for each rule: project-specific or organization-wide.

    This greatly simplifies the alerting system, while keeping a good level of flexibility.

    The [API endpoints for managing alert rules](/api-reference/platform/alert-rules/list-alert-rules) have also been updated to reflect this change, which should make it easier to manage your alert rules programmatically.

    ## Enhanced messaging reliability and logging

    To improve the resilience of the email notifications, a failover SMTP (Brevo) has been introduced to ensure uninterrupted delivery in case the primary SMTP (Scaleway) fails.

    Real-time tracking of email delivery statuses has been implemented to allow for immediate detection of undelivered emails.

    The Email, Telegram, and SMS integration have also been updated to provide per-recipient logs, giving you more details in case of delivery issues.

    ## New monitoring regions and infrastructure overhaul

    After two months of rollout and testing, Phareâ€™s newest regions, Australia, Thailand, and Brazil, are now generally available. These regions bring faster, closer monitoring to key areas across APAC and South America.

    All regions, new and existing, now run on an upgraded infrastructure. Expect lower latency, improved efficiency, and even more reliable insights, no changes needed.

    A major step forward in global monitoring, now fully live!

    <br/>

    ## New Scale plan price

    After nearly a year of intense optimization and some seriously messy spreadsheet formulas, it's finally done, Phare Scale plan is now just 5â‚¬, down from 49â‚¬!

    Thatâ€™s 90% off! And itâ€™s not just about slashing prices, itâ€™s about making powerful, high-quality tools accessible to everyone, without locking features behind expensive enterprise plans.

    The pricing page has been [updated to reflect this change and clarify things](https://phare.io/pricing).

    Nowâ€™s the perfect time to hop on board. Donâ€™t miss out, letâ€™s scale together.

    ## Discord community


    Phare now has a Discord community, because sometimes you just want to drop a quick message, rant about a bug, or throw out a wild feature idea explained in a meme.

    Join to chat about Phare, share feedback, report issues, or just see whatâ€™s brewing. It's also the best place to talk to the guy that write the code, and bully him into adding a dark mode (please donâ€™t).

    Jump in, say hi, and letâ€™s have fun: https://phare.io/discord

    ## Preview regions


    Six new regions are available in preview to test Phare's brand-new monitoring infrastructure. Theyâ€™re free to use for the next two months but come with no guarantees yet.

    Choose from US West / East ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, or one of the new regions, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º and Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. Or why not all of them to help us test the new infrastructure at scale?

    ## Improved integration reliability

    A lot of work has been done to improve the reliability of all integrations with third-party services. Including a new delivery and error logs page, failure notifications, and automatic pause for failing integrations.

    ### Delivery and error logs

    All integrations now provide a detailed logs page to help you diagnose and fix issues.

        <img src="/images/changelog/70-integration-logs.webp" alt="Integration logs" />
    </Frame>

    ### Failure notifications

    All integrations now notify the organization owner when an issue occurs. For the SMS, Email and Webhook integrations, a detailed list of failed number, address or requests is provided to help you identify the issue.

    The failure notification for the Outgoing Webhook integration is only sent if all delivery attempts have failed, which means organization owner will be notified [1 hour and 18 minutes]( https://docs.phare.io/integrations/outgoing-webhook#retry-policy) after the event creation.

    </Frame>

    ### Automatic pause

    Integrations that have been failing more than 3 consecutive times in a 7 days rolling window will be automatically paused. A notification will be sent to the organization owner when this happens.

    <br/>

    ## Data retention change

    To improve the performance of the platform and reduce unnecessary data retention, a few rules are now enforced for organizations on the **Hobby** plan:

    Organizations must have at least one active member in the past 6 months to keep their account active. Two reminder email will be sent to the organization owner before the account is deactivated. The first reminder is sent 14 days before the account deactivation, and the second reminder is sent 3 days before the account deactivation.

    Monitor that have been failing uninterrupted for more than 48h will be automatically paused. A notification will be sent to the organization owner when a monitor is paused.

    These rules are only enforced for organizations on the **Hobby** plan, and are necessary to keep this plan free and sustainable for everyone.

    ## Custom error pages for status pages

    When visiting a status page with an error (404, 500, etc.), a custom error page is now displayed to provide a better user experience, instead of redirecting users to a phare.io error page.

    ## Account security improvements

    The security of your user account has been improved with the addition of a password confirmation step when updating your email address or deactivating two-factor authentication. This step ensures that you are the owner of the account and that no one else can make changes without your consent. The two-factor authentication activation flow has also been improved with the possibility to manually set up your authenticator app without having to scan a QR code.

    Embed status badges can now be customized with a custom background color to match your website's design. A theme selector is available to choose between light and dark mode, and a color picker to select the background color for each theme.

    <br/>

    ## Embed status badges

    Three embeddable status badges are now available to display your status page's current status on your website. The badges do not load any third party scripts, are free from cookies, and adapt to your website dark and light mode.
