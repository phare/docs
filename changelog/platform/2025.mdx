<Update label="June 2025">
    ## Credits payment for Scale plan

    The Scale plan now supports prepayment, allowing you to pay for a few months, or a few years in advance. This allow you to only receive a single invoice for the entire period, and avoid monthly payments.

    This come with a slight change for users already on the Scale plan, as the plan is now payed at the end of the month instead of the beginning.

    ##  Enhanced incident details

    The information available in incident reports has been extended to includes:

    - ‚úÖ *Resolved address*: See the final hostname and port.
    - üî¢ *Status code*: Quickly verify the HTTP response status.
    - üß™ *Assertion results*: View detailed outcomes for each assertion.
    - üì¶ *Response size*: View the bytes size of the response body.
    - üßæ *Response headers*: Inspect the HTTP headers returned by the server.
    - üîç *Request trace*: Follow the full journey of the request through each step.

    The additional context should help you identify incident root causes more quickly and accurately.

    ## Updated inactivity restriction for Hobby plan

    Organizations on the **Hobby** plan are now automatically deactivated after 4 months of inactivity, instead of 6 months. This means that if your organization has no active members for 4 months, it will be deactivated and all data will be deleted after receiving two reminder emails.

    This change is necessary to keep the platform sustainable, and requesting 3 sign ins per year seems reasonable to ask for a free plan.

    ## Success assertions

    You can now define success assertions for your monitors, allowing you to specify custom checks for:

    - Status codes (with support for wildcards and multiple codes)
    - Response headers
    - Response body content

    ## TLS over TCP, and new monitoring options

    Monitoring secure TCP services with a TLS connection is now possible, allowing you to monitor a wider range of services. Certificates discovered during TCP monitoring are now tracked, and you can set up alert rules to be notified when they are about to expire.

    All types of monitors can now skip SSL/TLS certificate validation, which is useful for testing services with self-signed certificates.

    HTTP(S) monitors can now be configured to fail when facing a 3xx redirect response.

    ## Refreshed design

    Phare has a fresh new look! The design has been refreshed to be more modern and user-friendly, navigation should be more intuitive.

        <img src="/images/changelog/84-removed-integration-project-scope.webp" alt="Removed integration project scope" />
    </Frame>

    ## Integration project scope removed

    It was possible to scope integrations to a specific project, which was useful for advanced use cases of large organizations. However, this feature was not widely used and made integrations needlessly complex for most users, and Phare is all about the fine line between simplicity and sophistication, so bye-bye scoped integrations.

    ## Custom HTTP headers

    You can now add custom HTTP headers to your monitors. This is useful for passing authentication tokens, or any other headers required by your application.

    ## User agent secret key

    It is now possible to set a secret key of your choice to the user agent used for monitoring. This allows you to easily identify the requests made by Phare in your application logs, or filter them accurately in your firewall rules.

    The chosen secret key is passed as a user agent parameter with the following format:

    ```text
    Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Phare/1.0; +https://phare.io/products/uptime; Secret=your-secret-key)
    ```

    The user agent is left unchanged if no secret key is set:

    ```text
    Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Phare/1.0; +https://phare.io/products/uptime)
    ```

    ## New alert event: Monitor certificate expiring

    You can now create alert rules to be notified when your monitor certificates are about to expire. This new feature complements the SSL certificate tracking system introduced earlier this week, giving you proactive control over your certificate renewals.

    How it works:
    - Create a **Monitor Certificate Expiring** alert rule
    - Select how many days in advance you want to be notified (from 1 to 60 days)
    - Choose which integration to use for notifications (Email, SMS, Webhook, etc.)
    - Get timely notifications so you never miss a certificate renewal again

    Like other alert rules, you can scope it to a specific project or to the entire organization, and it works with all existing integrations.

    ## New alert event: Monitor certificate discovered

    You can now create alert rules to be notified when a new certificate is discovered on any monitor. It's a great way to make sure they're getting renewed on time, or to get alerted of any unexpected changes to your monitors' SSL certificates.
    <br/>

        <img src="/images/changelog/81-certificate-discovery.webp" alt="SSL certificate tracking" />
    </Frame>

    ## SSL certificate tracking

    Phare now tracks SSL certificates as first-class objects, giving you visibility on all the certificates used in your projects.

    How it works:

    - Certificates are discovered and stored automatically when performing monitor checks
    - Support for multiple certificates per domain and shared certificates across monitors

    This allows you to quickly view all certificates used by a monitor, and all monitors using a certificate.

        <img src="/images/changelog/78-alerting-system.webp" alt="New alerting system" />
    </Frame>

    ## New scoped alert rules system


    Alert policies have been replaced with a more intuitive scoped alert rules system. You can now define alert rules that apply at the organization or project level, making alerting easier to manage and more transparent.

    How it works:
    - Alert policies do not exist anymore
    - Alert rules can be directly created
    - Choose a scope for each rule: project-specific or organization-wide.

    This greatly simplifies the alerting system, while keeping a good level of flexibility.

    The [API endpoints for managing alert rules](/api-reference/platform/alert-rules/list-alert-rules) have also been updated to reflect this change, which should make it easier to manage your alert rules programmatically.

    ## Enhanced messaging reliability and logging

    To improve the resilience of the email notifications, a failover SMTP (Brevo) has been introduced to ensure uninterrupted delivery in case the primary SMTP (Scaleway) fails.

    Real-time tracking of email delivery statuses has been implemented to allow for immediate detection of undelivered emails.

    The Email, Telegram, and SMS integration have also been updated to provide per-recipient logs, giving you more details in case of delivery issues.

    ## New monitoring regions and infrastructure overhaul

    After two months of rollout and testing, Phare‚Äôs newest regions, Australia, Thailand, and Brazil, are now generally available. These regions bring faster, closer monitoring to key areas across APAC and South America.

    All regions, new and existing, now run on an upgraded infrastructure. Expect lower latency, improved efficiency, and even more reliable insights, no changes needed.

    A major step forward in global monitoring, now fully live!

    <br/>

    ## New Scale plan price

    After nearly a year of intense optimization and some seriously messy spreadsheet formulas, it's finally done, Phare Scale plan is now just 5‚Ç¨, down from 49‚Ç¨!

    That‚Äôs 90% off! And it‚Äôs not just about slashing prices, it‚Äôs about making powerful, high-quality tools accessible to everyone, without locking features behind expensive enterprise plans.

    The pricing page has been [updated to reflect this change and clarify things](https://phare.io/pricing).

    Now‚Äôs the perfect time to hop on board. Don‚Äôt miss out, let‚Äôs scale together.

    ## Discord community


    Phare now has a Discord community, because sometimes you just want to drop a quick message, rant about a bug, or throw out a wild feature idea explained in a meme.

    Join to chat about Phare, share feedback, report issues, or just see what‚Äôs brewing. It's also the best place to talk to the guy that write the code, and bully him into adding a dark mode (please don‚Äôt).

    Jump in, say hi, and let‚Äôs have fun: https://phare.io/discord

    ## Preview regions


    Six new regions are available in preview to test Phare's brand-new monitoring infrastructure. They‚Äôre free to use for the next two months but come with no guarantees yet.

    Choose from US West / East üá∫üá∏, Japan üáØüáµ, Germany üá©üá™, or one of the new regions, Australia üá¶üá∫ and Brazil üáßüá∑. Or why not all of them to help us test the new infrastructure at scale?

    ## Improved integration reliability

    A lot of work has been done to improve the reliability of all integrations with third-party services. Including a new delivery and error logs page, failure notifications, and automatic pause for failing integrations.

    ### Delivery and error logs

    All integrations now provide a detailed logs page to help you diagnose and fix issues.

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/70-integration-logs.webp" alt="Integration logs" />
    </Frame>

    ### Failure notifications

    All integrations now notify the organization owner when an issue occurs. For the SMS, Email and Webhook integrations, a detailed list of failed number, address or requests is provided to help you identify the issue.

    The failure notification for the Outgoing Webhook integration is only sent if all delivery attempts have failed, which means organization owner will be notified [1 hour and 18 minutes]( https://docs.phare.io/integrations/outgoing-webhook#retry-policy) after the event creation.

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/71-integration-issue-notification.webp" alt="Integration issue notification" />
    </Frame>

    ### Automatic pause

    Integrations that have been failing more than 3 consecutive times in a 7 days rolling window will be automatically paused. A notification will be sent to the organization owner when this happens.

    <br/>

    ## Data retention change

    To improve the performance of the platform and reduce unnecessary data retention, a few rules are now enforced for organizations on the **Hobby** plan:

    Organizations must have at least one active member in the past 6 months to keep their account active. Two reminder email will be sent to the organization owner before the account is deactivated. The first reminder is sent 14 days before the account deactivation, and the second reminder is sent 3 days before the account deactivation.

    Monitor that have been failing uninterrupted for more than 48h will be automatically paused. A notification will be sent to the organization owner when a monitor is paused.

    These rules are only enforced for organizations on the **Hobby** plan, and are necessary to keep this plan free and sustainable for everyone.

    ## Custom error pages for status pages

    When visiting a status page with an error (404, 500, etc.), a custom error page is now displayed to provide a better user experience, instead of redirecting users to a phare.io error page.

    ## Account security improvements

    The security of your user account has been improved with the addition of a password confirmation step when updating your email address or deactivating two-factor authentication. This step ensures that you are the owner of the account and that no one else can make changes without your consent. The two-factor authentication activation flow has also been improved with the possibility to manually set up your authenticator app without having to scan a QR code.

    Embed status badges can now be customized with a custom background color to match your website's design. A theme selector is available to choose between light and dark mode, and a color picker to select the background color for each theme.

    <br/>

    ## Embed status badges

    Three embeddable status badges are now available to display your status page's current status on your website. The badges do not load any third party scripts, are free from cookies, and adapt to your website dark and light mode.


    #### Pulse badge

    The pulse badge only display the current status of your status page without any additional information, making it perfect to build your own components around it.
