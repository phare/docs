    <img src="/images/changelog/57-control-incident-downtime.webp" alt="Control incident downtime" />
</Frame>

---

## Incident creation
_October 7th, 2024_

Incidents can now be created manually. This feature allows you to easily track and manage incidents that are not automatically detected by uptime monitoring checks.

It is now also possible to modify incidents created automatically by the platform, allowing you to customize incident titles shown on your status page and add more details to the incident report.

Manually created incidents use alert policies under the hood and are not automatically resolved when associated monitors are successful.

This feature makes it easier to communicate with users during incidents.

## Phare platform makeover
_August 5th, 2024_

The Phare platform received a makeover focused on improving the navigation and user experience. The new design provides a cleaner and more intuitive interface, making it easier to access the features you need. Most pages have been updated with many small improvements to improve the overall user experience.

Your monitoring pages have also been redesigned slightly and given a new filter to show performance data specific to a region. This allows you to quickly identify any regional performance issues and take appropriate action.

## Improved monitoring performance chart
_July 29th, 2024_

The algorithm used to generate the performance chart has been improved to provide a more accurate representation of your monitor's performance. This change allows for better anomaly removal and a more precise representation of the overall performance shown by your monitor.

Incidents are now displayed on the chart with their respective impact colors, making it easier to understand any correlation at a glance.

If you're interested in learning more about how Phare generates the performance chart, read the article on [downsampling time series data](/articles/downsampling-time-series-data).

## Custom domains for status pages
_July 22th, 2024_

You can now use your own domain for your status pages, providing a more seamless and branded experience for your users. This feature allows you to create a custom subdomain for your status pages, such as `status.example.com`, and link it to your Phare status page.

The Phare-provided subdomain `*.status.phare.io` attached to your status page will stay active and will automatically redirect users to your custom domain if you configure one.

Instructions on how to set up a custom domain for your status page can be found in the [documentation](/uptime/status-pages#custom-domain).

---

## Outgoing webhooks integration
_July 17th, 2024_

Outgoing webhooks are now available on the Phare platform, allowing you to connect with third-party tools or build your own integration.

The webhook payload can be customized for each alert rule event that you would like to use. You are free to use any valid JSON structure with access to many variables to help you build the perfect payload for your use case.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/48-outgoing-webhook-alert-rule.webp" alt="Outgoing webhooks alert rules" />
</Frame>

Webhooks are secured with an HMAC SHA-256 signature to ensure the authenticity of the payload in a way that is resistant to replay and timing attacks. A retry policy is also in place to ensure that your webhook is safely delivered, even if your server is temporarily down.

One more thing: you can also browse the history of the payloads sent to your webhook to easily debug and monitor the integration.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/49-outgoing-webhook-logs.webp" alt="Outgoing webhooks logs" />
</Frame>

You can learn more about the outgoing webhooks integration in the [documentation](/integrations/outgoing-webhook).

## Billing quotas estimation
_July 11th, 2024_

Billing quota forecasting has been released on the Phare platform. This new feature provides greater visibility into your billing quota usage, helping you manage your resources more effectively.

On your organization billing page, you can now see detailed forecasts of your quota usage. This includes predictions based on your current usage patterns, allowing you to plan ahead and avoid service interruptions.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/46-billing-quotas-estimation.webp" alt="Billing quotas estimation" />
</Frame>

You will also be alerted when creating or updating a monitor if the action exceeds your monthly quota. This real-time feedback helps you make informed decisions and ensures that your monitoring setup remains within your desired limits.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/47-monitoring-quotas-forecast.webp" alt="Monitoring quotas forecast" />
</Frame>

Billing transparency is a key part of the Phare platform, and the tooling helps you monitor and control usage effectively.

## New monitoring infrastructure
_May 26th, 2024_

Phare's monitoring infrastructure is the biggest operating cost and most important piece of the Phare Uptime product. As Phare performs millions of monitoring checks from many regions around the world, this infrastructure should be scalable, efficient, and most importantly reliable. As the platform grew over the past few months, the previous solution based on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) started to show its limits in terms of performance and cost, forcing a search for an alternative solution.

Phare has migrated all monitoring checks to a newly written infrastructure based on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). This solution helps maintain a generous free plan and competitive pricing for paid customers.

## REST API
_May 20th, 2024_

The Phare REST API has been released with associated [documentation](/api-reference/introduction). All endpoints required to manage monitors are already available. Other endpoints will be added in the next few weeks until all the actions you can perform in your dashboard can also be done programmatically.

You will need to generate an API key to authenticate your organization. You can choose an access scope (Read / Write) for each Phare product as well as access to the resources of the Phare platform.

More information is available on the [API documentation](/api-reference/introduction) page.

## Incident comment and update alert
_May 7th, 2024_

Two new alert rules have been created to let you know when your team is working on resolving an incident. The first one will alert you every time a new comment is published on an incident timeline, and the second when a team member publishes a status update for the incident.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/changelog/38-new-alert-rules.webp" alt="Incident comment and update alert" />

## Hosting provider migration
_May 2nd, 2024_

Phare migrated to a new datacenter managed by [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) in Germany. The switch was made on May 2nd and resulted in ~6 minutes of downtime on uptime monitoring and ~10 minutes of downtime on dashboard access. This infrastructure migration was performed to improve speed and reliability of the service.

A lot of work has also been put into disaster recovery, with four times more backup point every day and multi-region (all in Europe) replication.

This ensures that the service can be put back up with the smallest possible downtime in case the current datacenter has a major outage.
