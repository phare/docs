## Incident management enhancements
_November 8th, 2024_

Several improvements have been introduced to the incident management system to streamline incident creation and give you more control:

### Manual incident resolution

You can now manually resolve incidents, providing greater control over the incident lifecycle and ensuring accurate status reporting.

    <img class="border rounded-lg" src="/images/changelog/55-resolve-incidents.webp" alt="Manually resolve incidents" />
</Frame>

### Publish status update during incident creation

When creating a new incident, you can now publish a status update immediately, keeping your users informed from the very beginning.

<Frame type="glass">
    <img class="border rounded-lg" src="/images/changelog/56-publish-incident-updates-at-creation.webp" alt="Incident updates at creation" />
</Frame>

### Control on incident downtime calculation

You now have the ability to exclude an incident from the downtime calculation, allowing you to maintain accurate uptime metrics and avoid skewing your performance data. This feature is particularly useful for maintenance windows with downtime that are already part of your SLA, or for incidents that have minimal impact on your users.

## Incident creation
_October 7th, 2024_

Incidents can now be created manually, this feature allows you to easily track and manage incidents that are not automatically detected by uptime monitoring checks.

It is now also possible to modify incident created automatically by the platform, allowing you to customize incident titles shown on your status page, and add more details to the incident report.

Manually created incident uses alert policies under the hood, and are not automatically resolved when associated monitors are successful.

We hope that you will be able to better communicate with your users during incidents with this new feature.

## Improved monitoring performance chart
_July 29th, 2024_

The algorithm used to generate the performance chart has been improved to provide a more accurate representation of your monitor's performance. This change allows for better anomaly removal and a more precise representation of the overall performance showed by your monitor.

Incidents are now displayed on the chart with their respective impact color, making it easier to understand any correlation at a glance.

If you're interested in learning more about how we generate the performance chart, you can read our article on [downsampling time series data](/articles/downsampling-time-series-data).

## Custom domains for status pages
_July 22th, 2024_

You can now use your own domain for your status pages, providing a more seamless and branded experience for your users. This feature allows you to create a custom subdomain for your status pages, such as `status.example.com`, and link it to your Phare status page.

The Phare-provided subdomain `*.status.phare.io` attached to your status page will stay active and will automatically redirect users to your custom domain if you configure one.

Instructions on how to set up a custom domain for your status page can be found in the [documentation](/uptime/status-pages#custom-domain).

## Outgoing webhooks integration
_July 17th, 2024_

Outgoing webhooks are now available Phare platform, allowing you to connect with third-party tools or build your own integration.

The webhook payload can be customized for each alert rule event that you would like to use. You are free to use any valid JSON structure with access to many variables to help you build the perfect payload for your use case.

<Frame type="glass">
    <img class="border rounded-lg" src="/images/changelog/48-outgoing-webhook-alert-rule.webp" alt="Outgoing webhooks alert rules" />
</Frame>

Webhooks are secured with an HMAC sha256 signature to ensure the authenticity of the payload, in a way that is resistant to replay and timing attacks. A retry policy is also in place to ensure that your webhook is safely delivered, even if your server is temporarily down.

One more thing, you can also browse the history of the payloads sent to your webhook to easily debug and monitor the integration.

<Frame type="glass">
    <img class="border rounded-lg" src="/images/changelog/49-outgoing-webhook-logs.webp" alt="Outgoing webhooks logs" />
</Frame>

You can learn more about the outgoing webhooks integration in the [documentation](/integrations/outgoing-webhook).

## Monitoring timeout customization
_July 4th, 2024_

You can now customize the timeout duration for your monitors, offering greater control over your monitoring strategy for more accurate and reliable results.

This new feature allows you to set specific timeout values, taking into account DNS resolution, connection time, response time, and any redirections. By adjusting these settings, you can fine-tune the sensitivity of your checks to better meet your specific needs.

While the default timeout value of 7 seconds is optimized for most scenarios, providing a good balance and minimizing false positives, you now have the flexibility to modify this setting to better suit your unique requirements.

## New monitoring infrastructure
_May 26th, 2024_

Our monitoring infrastructure is the biggest operating cost and most important piece of the Phare Uptime product. As we perform millions of monitoring checks from many regions around the world, this infrastructure should be scalable, efficient and more importantly reliable. As we grew over the past few months, our previous solution based on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) started to show its limit in terms of performance and cost, forcing us to look for an alternative solution.

Today we migrated all monitoring checks to a newly written infrastructure based on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). This solution allows us to maintain our generous free plan and a competitive price for our paid customers.

## Hosting provider migration
_May 2nd, 2024_

Phare migrated to a new datacenter managed by [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) in Germany. The switch was made on May 2nd and resulted in ~6 minutes of downtime on uptime monitoring and ~10 minutes of downtime on dashboard access. This infrastructure migration was performed to improve speed and reliability of the service.

A lot of work has also been put into disaster recovery, with four times more backup point every day and multi-region (all in Europe) replication.

This ensures that the service can be put back up with the smallest possible downtime in case our current datacenter has a major outage.
