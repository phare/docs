## New API endpoints: alert rules, incidents and status pages
_July 7th, 2024_

New API endpoints are available to help you programmatically interact with the Phare platform:

- [Alert rules](/api-reference/platform/alert-rules/list-alert-rules)
- [Incidents](/api-reference/uptime/incidents/list-incidents)
- [Status pages](/api-reference/uptime/status-pages/list-status-pages)

These new API endpoints enhance your ability to automate and streamline your monitoring, alerting, and incident management workflows, offering a more integrated and efficient approach to maintaining service reliability.

# Monitoring timeout customization
_July 4th, 2024_

You can now customize the timeout duration for your monitors, offering greater control over your monitoring strategy for more accurate and reliable results.

This new feature allows you to set specific timeout values, taking into account DNS resolution, connection time, response time, and any redirections. By adjusting these settings, you can fine-tune the sensitivity of your checks to better meet your specific needs.

While the default timeout value of 7 seconds is optimized for most scenarios, providing a good balance and minimizing false positives, you now have the flexibility to modify this setting to better suit your unique requirements.

# Smart monitoring suggestion
_July 3rd, 2024_

We are introducing smart monitoring suggestions, designed to help you effortlessly optimize your monitors. This new feature provides tailored recommendations to enhance the accuracy and reliability of your monitoring.

Smart Suggestions will alert you of unnecessary redirects, which can slow down your site's reported performance, and recommend using multiple regions for monitoring if you currently use only a single region. By following these suggestions, you can ensure more comprehensive coverage and faster detection of potential issues.

## New monitoring infrastructure
_May 26th, 2024_

Our monitoring infrastructure is the biggest operating cost and most important piece of the Phare Uptime product. As we perform millions of monitoring checks from many regions around the world, this infrastructure should be scalable, efficient and more importantly reliable. As we grew over the past few months, our previous solution based on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) started to show its limit in terms of performance and cost, forcing us to look for an alternative solution.

Today we migrated all monitoring checks to a newly written infrastructure based on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). This solution allows us to maintain our generous free plan and a competitive price for our paid customers.

## REST API
_May 20th, 2024_

The Phare REST API has been released with associated [documentation](/api-reference/introduction). All endpoints required to manage monitors are already available, other endpoints will be added in the next few weeks until all the action you can perform in your dashboard can also be done programmatically.

You will need to generate an API key to authenticate your organization, you are able to choose an access scope (Read / Write) for each Phare product as well as access to the resources of the Phare platform.

More informations are available on the [API documentation](/api-reference/introduction) page.

## Hosting provider migration
_May 2nd, 2024_

Phare migrated to a new datacenter managed by [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) in Germany. The switch was made on May 2nd and resulted in ~6 minutes of downtime on uptime monitoring and ~10 minutes of downtime on dashboard access. This infrastructure migration was performed to improve speed and reliability of the service.

A lot of work has also been put into disaster recovery, with four times more backup point every day and multi-region (all in Europe) replication.

This ensures that the service can be put back up with the smallest possible downtime in case our current datacenter has a major outage.
