## Incident impact
_October 27th, 2023_

The design of the incident management page has been improved, with all actions now part of the timeline. You can now select an impact level for your incidents.

</Frame>

---

## Admin user role
_October 23rd, 2023_

A new **Admin** role is now available. This role is similar to the former **Owner** role, with the exception that it can't delete the organization, making it easier to share the management of an organization with other team members.

You can review the available permissions of each role in the [user management documentation](https://docs.phare.io/user-management). Role can be modified on existing users, as well as directly when inviting a new user.

## Status pages
_October 21st, 2023_

Status pages are now available for all users, and they're **the most carbon-efficient status page on the market with an incredibly fast load time**. You can create unlimited status pages with a phare domain name, and personalize it with limited branding options.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Status Page" src="/images/changelog/33-status-pages.webp" />

---

## European mail server
_September 17th, 2023_

The mail server used to send you alert notifications has been moved to a new provider based in Europe, making Phare 100% european for non-subscribed users. This is part of Phare commitment to privacy and data protection, using only services from companies that are headquartered in Europe and hosted in european datacenters.

The only exception is Stripe, a US-based company used to process billing information and payments.

---

## New branding
_August 21st, 2023_

Bye bye MinKit and hello Phare! The platform has been renamed to Phare and has a new logo. The new name is a reference to the lighthouse, a beacon of light that helps ships navigate safely. This symbole is a good representation of our mission to give you a signal when you need it so that you can run high quality production websites.

We hope that you like the new name and logo.

The old domain name `minkit.io` will continue to work for about a year, but you should update your bookmarks and password manager as soon as possible to avoid any inconvenience in the future.

## Improved monitoring page
_August 18th, 2023_

Visualisation of incident periods in the performance chart has been improved, and you can now get your website's average response time, cumulated downtime and availability % for the selected time period (24 hours, 7 days, 30 days or 90 days).

<Frame>
    <img alt="Monitoring statistics" src="/images/changelog/31-monitoring-statistics.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Faster monitoring statistics
_August 17th, 2023_

A lot of work has been done to improve the monitoring statistics. With 15M records in the database, it was starting to be a bit slow to load monitoring results for our own standard, because we're obsessed with speed. [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) came to the rescue, saving up to 500ms on every page load. If you visit your monitoring page twice a day, that's 6 minutes of your life saved every year! You're welcome.

---

## Reviews
_August 15th, 2023_

A new review page has been added to the website with a list of all the places where you can leave a review of the platform. If you like Phare, please consider leaving an honest review on one of these platforms. The first 85 reviews created on Capterra will **receive a $20 gift card**!

<Frame>
    <img alt="Write a review" src="/images/changelog/30-review.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Deletion safeguard
_July 29th, 2023_

A new safeguard has been added to the platform to prevent accidental deletion of important data. When you try to delete your user account, a project, or your organization, you will be asked to confirm your action with a small typing challenge. This will prevent you from accidentally deleting your account or organization.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Deletion safeguard" src="/images/changelog/29-deletion-safeguard.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Alert rules duplication
_July 28th, 2023_

You can now duplicate an alert rule to rapidly create a new one with the same configuration. This is useful if you want to create a new alert rule with a similar configuration to an existing one.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Alert rules duplication" src="/images/changelog/28-alert-rule-duplication.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Performance monitoring history
_June 4th, 2023_

It is now possible to navigate the performance history of your monitors, with three available time ranges of 24 hours, 7 days and 90 days. This is a first step towards giving you more flexibility on how you view and access your monitoring data.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Performance monitoring history" src="/images/changelog/27-performance-history.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Improved uptime precision
_May 29th, 2023_

Uptime percentage is now calculated with four digits precision which allows us to better calculate your long time SLA. For example, 99.9999% uptime means that your service can be down for 31 seconds per year.

Badges also got updated with four digits precision.

<Frame>
<img alt="Improved uptime precision" src="/images/changelog/26-improved-uptime-precision.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Incident events improvements
_May 27th, 2023_

Incident events now show more precise date and time information. With the exact time of the event, and the elapsed time since the creation of the incident.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Incident event date time" src="/images/changelog/24-incident-event-date-time.webp" />
</Frame>

A tooltip with the exact date and time is also available on hover of all the already existing dates and times in the Phare dashboard.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Datetime tooltip" src="/images/changelog/25-datetime-tooltip.webp" />
</Frame>

## Multi-quota billing alerts
_May 17th, 2023_

A fairly technical feature, but important for the future of the platform. With the release of the SMS integration last week, we now offer two different billing quotas: SMS alerts and monitoring events. The billing alert system, which is responsible for sending you emails when a quota is exhausted, was the last piece of the billing infrastructure that only supported Monitoring events.

In simpler terms, the platform now has all the required foundation to bill anything, as part of a monthly plan or as additional usage. New feature will not require work on the billing infrastructure anymore, allowing me to ship faster!

<Frame>
    <img alt="Multi-quota alerts" src="/images/changelog/23-multi-quota-alerts.webp" />

## Integrations documentation
_May 14th, 2023_

The [documentation for the integrations](https://docs.phare.io/integrations/overview) has been created, mostly to include information on the new SMS integration. You can find a few tips on configuration, supported country, the address email and phone numbers we use to send alerts, and much more.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Integration documentation" src="/images/changelog/22-integrations-documentation.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## SMS integration
_May 13th, 2023_

Phare now offers SMS alerts! You can receive SMS alerts by configuring the new SMS integration. The SMS integration is only available on the Scale plan with 100 alerts included monthly.

<Frame>
    <img alt="SMS integration" src="/images/changelog/20-sms-integrations.webp" />
</Frame>

You can add a phone number to their profile, which will be used to send SMS alerts. You will have to validate your phone number by entering a code sent by SMS. Team members that do not yet confirm a phone number can still be added to the SMS integration, but they will not receive the SMS alerts, a fallback solution will be added in the future.

<Frame>
    <img alt="SMS integration" src="/images/changelog/21-sms-integration-configuration.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Improved design
_May 10th, 2023_

The [home](https://phare.io) and [pricing](https://phare.io/pricing) pages got updated with frostier design; we hope that you like as much as we do. A few other pages got updated as well to improve consistency across the website.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Improved design" src="/images/changelog/19-improved-design.webp" />

## Public launch
_May 5th, 2023_

The public launch on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/phare-uptime) went well, we're happy to see the first unsolicited users signing up and using the platform. We're also happy to see that the platform is stable and reliable, as only a few minor bugs were reported and fixed since the launch.

Thanks to everyone who voted for us on ProductHunt and participated in any way to the launch, it means a lot.

During the same period, we also acquired our first paying customer, which is a great milestone for the project.

## Documentation
_May 4th, 2023_

Documentation has been published, it's still a work in progress, but it's already a great resource to learn about what our platform has to offer and how to use it.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Documentation" src="/images/changelog/17-documentation.webp" />

## Bunny CDN
_April 10th, 2023_

This week we migrated from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to [Bunny.net](https://bunny.net/). Bunny is a reliable content delivery platform with lightning-fast performances, making our platform even faster than before.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Performance" src="/images/changelog/16-performance.webp" />
</Frame>

But speed is not the only reason we spent a few days to migrate our service. Bunny is a European Union company, based in Slovenia.

This migration is part of our effort to rely as much as possible on European provider and ensure maximum privacy to our users.

## Billing overage management
_April 09th, 2023_

One feature was missing in the billing cycle released last week, managing overage, which occurs when your organization consumes more events than allowed in its subscription plan. You will now receive two emails, when 90% and 100% of your monthly allowed quota has been used. A free overage of 10 additional percent is offered before your account gets locked until the next billing period, or until you subscribe or upgrade your plan.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Overage management" src="/images/changelog/15-overage-management.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## End of beta
_April 8th, 2023_

With 3.5M checks successfully performed, 272 incidents reported, and 639 notifications sent, we can confidently say all systems are stable enough to end the beta program. The last 6 weeks have been productive, with lots of features and improvements on the platform, and we heard a public launch might happen in early May!

If you would like to support our launch on ProductHunt, you can [subscribe here to get notified](https://www.producthunt.com/products/phare).

---

## Paid plan activation
_April 6th, 2023_

With the end of the beta program incoming, the payment integration has been activated, which means no more unlimited usage on the free plan! We spent most of this week making sure the billing system was working as expected, and that monitoring events are reported fairly every month.

---

## Incidents on performance chart
_April 2nd, 2023_

A small change, but a welcome one to the performance chart, as you can now see incidents directly, and how they impact your website performance.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Incidents on performance chart" src="/images/changelog/14-incidents-on-performance-chart.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Frequently asked questions
_April 1st, 2023_

The pricing page now shows some frequently asked questions that I hope makes everything clearer about how Phare works. This is a small first step to fully fledged documentation.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Frequently asked questions" src="/images/changelog/13-faq.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Stress test
_March 28th, 2023_

To make sure that our platform continues to work flawlessly under load, thousands of test monitors have been created for a few days to expose any performance weakness. We could identify a few culprits in the way we calculated uptime average and stored monitoring results, that are now fixed.

On older monitors, the statistic page could take up to a second to show, which is not on par with the rest of the platform in terms of performance. It has been improved and should now be displayed in under 100ms.

---

## Pagination
_March 26th, 2023_

Dealing with so many monitors was impossible without a pagination, which is now active on most pages like projects, environments, monitors, incidents, and alert policies.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Pagination" src="/images/changelog/12-pagination.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Authentication pages redesign
_March 24th, 2023_

A small redesign of the authentication pages was made to make the pages more coherent with the overall design of the new landing pages created last week.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Authentication pages" src="/images/changelog/11-authentication-pages.webp" />
</Frame>

---

## Legal
_March 22nd, 2023_

We published our [terms of services](https://phare.io/legal/terms-of-service) and [privacy policy](https://phare.io/legal/privacy-policy). This was not the funniest task, but a necessary one as we approach open beta.

---

## Improved billing
_March 19th, 2023_

Billing is not yet active during the private beta, giving time to make sure everything is simple and works as expected. Wording around plans, billing, and quotas have been reviewed and changed to make things easier to understand. The offer is also simplified with a limited free (Hobby) plan, and a single paid (Scale) plan. The paid plan, as the name suggests, grows with your organization needs thanks to additional quotas that can be configured.

A detailed pricing calculator is now available on a new [pricing page](https://phare.io/pricing).

The billing page presents a fresh look with more detailed information on included and additional usage for all products:

<Frame>
    <img alt="Phare billing management" src="/images/changelog/10-billing-management.webp" />

---

## Members management
_March 15th, 2023_
It is now possible to invite your colleagues to your organization, all accounts have unlimited numbers, the more, the merrier.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Phare members management" src="/images/changelog/9-members-management.webp" />
</Frame>

You can assign members to projects and choose who has access to a project during creation.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Phare project with members" src="/images/changelog/8-project-with-members.webp" />
</Frame>

For now, all members can perform every possible action in the scope of their respective project. More granular role management will come later.

---

## New landing page
_March 9th, 2023_

Our landing page received a small makeover, a new marketing-oriented page has been created to present the Phare Uptime product with more details.

Go check out the new [Phare Uptime landing page](https://phare.io/products/uptime).

## New alert rules
_March 9th, 2023_

Two new rules have been added with the introduction of incident management, one that triggers when a new incident is created and one when an incident has recovered.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Incident alert rules" src="/images/changelog/7-incident-alert-rules.webp" />
</Frame>

Theses two new rules replace the former `Monitor status changed` rule that longer exists. All user's default alert policy rules have been updated to reflect this change.

---

## Incident management
_March 8th, 2023_

Monitors now automatically create and resolve incidents, this behavior can be configured in each monitor's settings with two new parameters.

- Incident confirmations: number of failing checks required before creating an incident.
- Recovery confirmations: number of successful checks required before resolving an incident.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Incident management configuration" src="/images/changelog/6-incident-management-configuration.webp" />
</Frame>

All incidents are shown in the incidents section of MinUptime, you can quickly see their status and act accordingly.

<Frame>
    <img alt="Incidents" src="/images/changelog/5-incidents.webp" />
</Frame>

To help you fix the situation, a timeline of events linked to an incident is shown on the incident's page.
