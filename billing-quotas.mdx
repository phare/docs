The billing page shows live usage for the current billing period, with data updated every hour. Each quota displays:

- **Included quota**: Usage included with the plan.
- **Additional quota**: Optional limits that can be added on paid plans.
- **Free overage (+10%)**: A buffer shown in the usage view.
- **Forecast**: A projected usage marker for the current period.

## Additional quotas

Additional quotas act as an upper limit for the invoice. Unused quota is not billed, and limits can be adjusted at any time.

Additional quotas are available on the Scale plan. The Hobby plan does not include additional usage.

## Billing portal

The billing portal provides subscription management, payment method updates, and access to past invoices. It is managed by Paddle, Phare's payment provider.
