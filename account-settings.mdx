Account settings are managed from the <a href="https://app.phare.io/user/settings" rel="nofollow">user settings</a> page. This page covers preferences, contact details, password updates, and two-factor authentication.

## Profile preferences

Use the preferences section to tailor the dashboard experience:

- **Timezone**: Controls how dates and times are displayed.
- **Time format**: Toggle between 24h and 12h formats.

## Notification preferences

Notification preferences control organization-level email alerts:

- **Quota threshold notifications**: Get alerted when one of your organization’s quota threshold is reached.
- **Integration issues notifications**: Get alerted when one of your organization’s integration is experiencing issues.
- **Uptime issues notifications**: Get alerted when one of your organization’s uptime resource is experiencing issues.

## Email

Update the account email used for alerts and sign-in. A password confirmation step is required when changing the email address.

## Phone number

Add a phone number to receive SMS and Voice alerts. A verification code is sent after entry, with options to resend or cancel the verification flow.

## Password

Change the account password by entering the current password, a new password, and a confirmation.

## Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (TOTP) adds a second step during sign-in. Setup uses a QR code and a confirmation code, with a manual TOTP URI available if needed.

Compatible apps include 2FAS, Authy, FreeOTP, and Google Authenticator.
