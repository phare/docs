description: 'Create programmatic interactions with the Phare API.'

<Warning>Please be aware that **the Phare API is currently in beta** and is subject to change.</Warning>

This API lets you interact programmatically with the Phare platform, enabling integration and automation for most tasks available in the control panel.

## Create an API key

<Info>Only team members with the **Owner** or **Admin** role can create an API key in your organization.</Info>

To access the Phare API, create an API key with the right access. This can be done in the <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/api-keys" rel="nofollow">control panel</a>.

When creating an API key, choose an access scope (Read / Write) for each Phare product as well as access to the resources of the Phare platform. The list of available endpoints is in the left navigation of this documentation.

You can create as many keys as necessary to fit your use case.

<Frame>
    <div style={{position: 'relative', width: '100%', 'padding-top': '56.25%'}}>
        <iframe
            src="https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/238508/0ec7b14b-4512-4fc5-b74e-b42f8152c596?autoplay=false&loop=true&muted=true&preload=true&responsive=true"
            loading="lazy"
            allow="accelerometer;gyroscope;autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture;fullscreen"
            style={{border: 0, position: 'absolute', top: 0, height: '100%', width: '100%'}}
        ></iframe>
    </div>
</Frame>

## Authentication

The Phare API uses Bearer Token Authentication to secure access to its endpoints. To authenticate your requests, include the API key in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. The format for this header is as follows:

```bash Request Authorization header
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Here’s an example of a cURL command to list the monitors in your project using your API key:

```sh
curl \
-X GET "https://api.phare.io/uptime/monitors" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>Keep your API key confidential at all times. Do not share it publicly or expose it in client-side code.</Warning>

If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, revoke it immediately through your control panel and generate a new one.

## Rate limiting

Access to the API is currently rate limited to **100 calls per minute** across the organization. All API keys share the same limit.

If an API endpoint is missing or a custom rate limit is needed, [contact support](mailto:support@phare.io). Phare can help find a solution that fits the use case.
