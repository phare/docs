<Warning>This integration is only available with a Scale plan subscription and in selected countries</Warning>

When email just won't cut it and you need alerts that grab attention immediately, the SMS integration delivers critical notifications straight to your phone. Configure it in the <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integration section</a> of your dashboard.

## Phone number validation

For security and to prevent misuse, each team member needs to verify their phone number before receiving alerts. It's simple, just visit the <a href="https://app.phare.io/user/settings" rel="nofollow">user settings</a> page and follow the verification steps.

## Configuration

You can include up to 25 team members in each SMS integration. When searching for team members, you'll see instantly who has a verified phone number ready to go. Don't worry if someone hasn't verified their number yet, you can still add them, and they'll start receiving alerts once they complete verification.

## Receiving SMS

When an alert triggers, your configured team members will receive a text message from the **Phare** originator, which is a special sender ID that identifies the message as coming from Phare.
