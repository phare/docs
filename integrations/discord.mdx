Bring your monitoring alerts right where your team hangs out! The Discord integration sends alerts directly to your chosen Discord channel, so you won't miss a beat when something needs attention. Set it up in your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>.

## Configuration

Need alerts in different Discord channels? No problem! You can create multiple Discord integrations, each pointing to a specific channel. When you set up a Discord integration, you will be redirected to Discord to authorize the Phare app and select the right Discord server and channel for your alerts.

<Tip>
    Pro tip: If you're a member of multiple Discord servers, double-check that
    you're selecting the right one during the authorization step.
</Tip>

A name will be automatically suggested for your integration, feel free to give it a more descriptive name that helps you identify it when setting up alert rules later, especially if you're connecting to multiple channels or servers.
