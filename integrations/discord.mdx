The Discord integration allows you to send alert on a Discord server channel. You can find and configure it in the <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integration</a> section of your dashboard.

## Configuration

You can configure a single Discord channel per integration, and create as many integrations as needed to receive alerts on multiple Discord channels. When installing the Discord integration, you will be redirected to Discord to authorize the Phare application to send messages to your Discord server.

If you are a member of multiple Discord server, make sure to select the right one when authorizing the Phare application.

A default name will be used for your integration, but you can change it to anything you want. The name will be used to identify the integration in the list of integrations when configuring alert rules.
