Need proper on-call management for your monitoring alerts? The [ilert](https://www.ilert.com/?utm_campaign=316508387-Phare%20Uptime&utm_source=integration&utm_medium=organic) integration makes sure the right people get notified when things go wrong, with automatic escalation and resolution when your services bounce back. Set it up in your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start routing alerts to ilert, you'll need an active ilert account with permissions to create alert sources. That's it!

## ilert Setup

First stop: your ilert dashboard. You'll need to create an alert source to catch those Phare alerts.

1. Head to **Alert sources** in ilert
2. Click **Create new alert source**
3. Search for "Phare.io", click the Phare.io tile and hit **Next**

4. Give a name to your alert source and configure it as you wish

    />
</Frame>

5. Once configured, you will receive an integration key for the alert source

    />
</Frame>

That's it for the ilert side of things. Copy the integration key somewhere safe, then follow the next steps to forward Phare alerts to the newly created ilert alert source.

## Phare Setup

1. Navigate to your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>
2. Find **ilert** and click **New installation**
3. Configure the **ilert** integration with a name and your **integration key** from the previous step

    />
</Frame>

4. Click **Create** to save your integration

Your ilert integration is ready to be used. You can now create alert rules to send data to ilert.

## Alert Rules

1. Head over to the <a href="https://app.phare.io/uptime/alert-rules" rel="nofollow">alert rules</a> page, and ensure the project on the top left of your screen is the right one.
2. Create two new Alert Rules (or edit existing ones) with the following event configuration:
- Incident created
- Incident recovered
3. Save your changes

## Automatic Resolution

When your service comes back online, Phare will now automatically tell ilert to resolve the alert. No manual cleanup needed! Your on-call team gets the complete story from problem to resolution, all without lifting a finger.
