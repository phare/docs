The Pushover integration allows you to send alert on your preferred device using the Pushover app. You can find and configure it in the [integration](https://app.phare.io/organization/apps) section of your dashboard.

## Pre-requisites

In order to use the Pushover integration, you need to have a Pushover account and create an application on the Pushover website to obtain an API Key.

You can find your user key in the [Pushover dashboard](https://pushover.net/) and the link to [create a new application](https://pushover.net/apps/build) at the bottom of your dashboard page. You are free to configure the application as you wish, or you can copy the following settings:

- Name: Phare
- Description: Receive notifications from Phare.io
- URL: https://phare.io
- Icon: [Phare logo](https://phare.io/img/logo-pushover.png)

## Configuration

To configure the Pushover integration in Phare, you need to provide your user key and the API key you obtained when creating the application.

## Usage

Once the integration is configured, you can select it as a notification channel when creating or editing alert rules. Each alert rule can specify a Pushover priority, allowing fine-grained control over the priority of each notification.

Alerts configured with the `Emergency` priority will require two additional parameters: `retry` and `expire`. These parameters are used to resend the notification if it's not acknowledged within the specified time frame and their behavior is [documented in the Pushover documentation](https://pushover.net/api#priority).
