Want your monitoring alerts delivered straight to your pocket? The Pushover integration lets you receive instant notifications on your phone, tablet, or desktop. Configure it in your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start receiving Pushover notifications from Phare, you'll need two things:

1. A Pushover account (they have a one-time purchase model, no subscriptions!)
2. A Pushover application set up to connect with Phare

You can find your user key in the [Pushover dashboard](https://pushover.net/), and create a new application via the link at the bottom of that page. Feel free to customize your app however you like, or use these ready-made settings:

- Name: Phare
- Description: Receive notifications from Phare.io
- URL: https://phare.io
- Icon: [Phare logo](https://phare.io/img/logo-pushover.png)

## Configuration

Setting up the integration is simple, just connect the dots between Phare and Pushover by adding your user key and the API key from your newly created Pushover application.

## Usage

With everything connected, you can choose Pushover as a notification channel when creating or editing alert rules. One of the coolest features? You can set different priority levels for different types of alerts, making that 3AM wake-up call reserved for truly critical issues.

If you choose the `Emergency` priority level, you'll need to specify two additional parameters:
- `retry`: How often (in seconds) the alert should repeat
- `expire`: How long (in seconds) the alert should continue trying before giving up

These parameters help ensure critical alerts don't go unnoticed, and you can learn more about them in the [Pushover API documentation](https://pushover.net/api#priority).
