Integrations are a way to connect your Phare account with external services. At the moment, integration can only be used as notification channels, but more integration types will be added in the future.

Integration can be configured in the [Integrations](https://app.phare.io/project/apps) section of your dashboard. You can create an unlimited number of integrations and choose for each one if they're available for your whole organization or scope them by project.

## Alert integrations

Alert integrations are used to send notifications when an alert rule is triggered. You can define the integration to use for each alert rule in an alert policy to route the notification to the right channel for your team.

The following integrations are available for alerting:
