Good old email, still the backbone of professional communications! Phare's Email integration makes sure critical alerts land right in your team's inboxes. Set it up in the <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integration section</a> of your dashboard.

## Email validation

To keep things secure and spam-free, only email addresses belonging to registered team members can receive alerts. Don't worry, support for generic addresses and distribution lists is on the roadmap, and you can [contact support](https://phare.io/contact) if you need a workaround in the meantime.

## Configuration

You can include up to 25 team members in each Email integration. Need to notify different groups for different alerts? Just create multiple Email integrations with the right people in each.

## Receiving Emails

All alerts come from the following address:

- **alerts@phare.io**

Email delivery is no joke! That's why Phare uses not one, but two reliable SMTP providers for failover and redundancy:

- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/)
- [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/)

This dual-provider approach means your critical alerts have a better chance of reaching you, even in the rare event one provider is experiencing issues.
