The Email integration allows you to send alert on any of your team members' emails. You can find and configure it in the <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integration</a> section of your dashboard.

## Email validation

To avoid spam and abuse, emails can only be sent to one of your registered team member's email. Support for generic email addresses will be added in the future.

## Configuration

Up to 25 team members can be configured to receive alerts for each Email integration.

## Receiving Emails

All alert emails are sent from the following email address:

- **alerts@phare.io**

Phare's rely on two SMTP providers to send emails for reliability and redundancy:
- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/)
- [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/)
