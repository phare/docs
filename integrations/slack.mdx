The Slack integration allows you to send alert on a Slack workspace channel. You can find and configure it in the [integration](https://app.phare.io/organization/apps) section of your dashboard.

## Configuration

You can configure a single Slack channel per integration, and create as many integrations as needed to receive alerts on multiple Slack channels. When installing the Slack integration you will be redirected to Slack to authorize the Phare application to send messages to your Slack workspace.

If you are a member of multiple Slack workspaces, make sure to select the right one when authorizing the Phare application.

A default name will be used for your integration, but you can change it to anything you want. The name will be used to identify the integration in the list of integrations when configuring alert rules.
