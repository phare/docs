Keep your team in the loop with the Phare integration for Slack! Get alerts delivered directly to your team's go-to communication hub, where the conversations already happen.

## Installation

Getting started is easy. Head over to your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>, find Slack in the list, and click the **New installation** button.

You'll be redirected to Slack's authorization page where you can give Phare permission to send those important notifications to your workspace.

## Configuration

Each Slack installation connects to one channel, but don't worry, you can create multiple integrations if you want alerts in different channels. Maybe critical issues go to #incidents while minor hiccups go to #monitoring? The choice is yours!

<Tip>
    Pro tip: If you belong to several Slack workspaces, double-check you're connecting to the right one during setup.
</Tip>

A default name will be suggested for your integration, feel free to change it for something more descriptive that makes sense for your team, especially helpful when you're setting up multiple Slack integrations.

## Receiving Slack messages

When an alert rule triggers, Phare will send an informative message to your selected Slack channel with all the details your team needs. To learn more about configuring when and how these alerts trigger, check out our [alerting documentation](/uptime/alerting).

## Privacy

Phare only shares the minimum information needed with Slack to deliver your notifications. Phare stores your workspace name, identifier, and an access token for sending messages. For the full details on how your data is handled, take a look at the [privacy policy](https://phare.io/legal/privacy-policy).
