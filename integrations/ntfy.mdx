Ntfy is a simple and open-source notification service that allows you to receive push notifications on your devices. With the Phare integration for Ntfy, you can get real-time alerts about your monitored services directly to your preferred platform. Configure it in your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start receiving Ntfy notifications from Phare, you'll need to have installed the app on your device or create an account on the [web client](https://ntfy.sh/). Once you're set up, you can create a topic on which you wish to receive notifications.

<Warning>Keep in mind that all Ntfy topics are public, so choose a unique name to avoid unwanted noise, or create your own server protected with an access token.</Warning>

## Configuration

To configure the integration in Phare, head over to your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>, find Ntfy in the list, and click the **New installation** button. Fill in the topic you created earlier and custom server hostname if required.

## Usage

With everything connected, you can choose Ntfy as a notification channel when creating or editing alert rules. The best part? You can set different priority levels for different types of alerts, making that 3AM wake-up notification reserved for truly critical issues.

You can learn more about Ntfy priority levels in the [Ntfy documentation](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/#message-priority).
