Love the speed and simplicity of Telegram? This integration brings Phare alerts directly to your Telegram chats, perfect for teams that prefer its secure, lightweight messaging experience. Set it up in your <a href="https://app.phare.io/organization/apps" rel="nofollow">integrations dashboard</a>.

## Configuration

After creating your Telegram integration in Phare, you'll get two convenient options:

- **Personal alerts**: A link/QR code that connects the Phare bot to your personal Telegram account. Share this with anyone on your team who wants alerts on their individual accounts.
- **Group alerts**: A link/QR code for adding the bot to an existing Telegram group, ideal for team-wide monitoring alerts.

<Warning>Security note: You can't add the Phare bot by searching for it directly from the Telegram app, you must use our provided links or QR codes. This prevents unauthorized access to your monitoring alerts.</Warning>

## Usage

That's it! Your Telegram account is now ready to receive Phare alerts. If you ever need to stop receiving notifications, just send the `/stop` command to the Phare bot and delete the conversation.
