The Telegram integration allows you to send alerts to your Telegram account. You can find and configure it in the [integration](https://app.phare.io/organization/apps) section of your dashboard.

## Configuration

Once your Telegram integration created in your Phare dashboard, two links / QR codes will be displayed.

- The first one is used to receive Phare alerts in a private conversation with the Phare Telegram bot. You can share this link with your team members to allow them to receive alerts on their Telegram account.
- The second one is used to receive alerts on an existing Telegram group.

After opening the link or scanning the QR code, follow the instructions on your device and start the conversation with the Phare Telegram bot. You will receive a message confirming that the integration is successfully configured.

<Warning>For security reasons, it is not possible to receive Phare alerts by adding directly the Phare Telegram bot from the application. You must use the provided links or QR code.</Warning>

## Usage

Once the integration is configured, you will start receiving alerts in your Telegram application. If you would like to stop receiving alerts, you can use the `/stop` command in the conversation with the Phare Telegram bot and then delete the conversation.
