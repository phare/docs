Ready to level up your monitoring game? This guide will walk you through the quick onboarding process to get started with Phare. By the end, you'll have your own organization account and know how to start using Phare products to run successful websites and APIs.

## Account Creation

First things firstâ€”you need a Phare account. Head over to the [registration page](https://app.phare.io/register) and sign up in just a few clicks.

Once you've created your account, watch for a confirmation email in your inbox. Click the confirmation link to verify your account and log in to Phare. Easy!

## Plan Selection

Now it's time to [choose your plan](https://phare.io/pricing). There's only two options: Hobby (free) and Scale (paid). Both plans pack the same powerful features, but the Hobby plan comes with more restricted usage limits. Don't worry about commitment, you can change or upgrade your plan whenever you need to.

If you go with the Scale plan, you'll be redirected over Phare's payment processor, Stripe, to fill in your billing details. They will take good care of your payment information, and Phare will never see your credit card details.

Stripe is a trusted payment processor used by some of the biggest companies in the world. They are [PCI compliant](https://docs.stripe.com/security) and have a strong track record of security.

## Project Creation

With your plan sorted, it's time to create your first project! Think of projects as containers for organizing your resources. In Phare, everything lives either directly in your organization or within a project inside your organization.

<Tip>
    Pro tip: To keep things tidy, try mirroring your organization's actual
    structure in how you set up your projects. And remember, projects also
    control who can access what. So if something should only be visible to
    certain team members, give it its own project.
</Tip>
